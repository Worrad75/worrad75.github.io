    <br><br>
    <h4>Who Am I?</h4>
    <p>
        <span>I'm Darrow, a 26-year old web developer from New York City.</span> I've been building full-stack
        applications
        for almost 4 years now, and I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of frameworks and technologies
        across different employers and projects. I've always had an appreciation for computers, so the day that I
        realized coding was basically just talking to one, I was hooked.
    </p>
    <h4>How Did I Get Here?</h4>
    <p>
        <span>In 2019, I graduated from Brandeis University</span> with a Bachelors of Arts in African and Afro-American
        Studies, and a Minor in Economics. I've always tried to be cognisant of the impact I have on the world and the
        people around me, and my schooling reinforced for me the importance of reaching outside your comfort zone to
        obtain new perspectives; a problem that has been solved from only 1 point of view has not actually been solved.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Right out of college, I knew I wanted to become a developer, so I joined <span>Flatiron School</span>. There,
        I learned what I meant to work with websites, progressing from Ruby on Rails and SQL to Javascript and
        eventually React and Redux. At the start of 2020, I joined <span>Infosys Limited</span> as a Software Engineer,
        and I was fortunate to work for their client UBS, an international bank. In addition to the incredible people
        I met during my time there, what I took most from it was a deeper understanding of how finiancial technologies
        were built, maintained, and revamped over time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Midway through 2021, I joined <span>Attentive Mobile</span> as a Solutions Engineer at the suggestion of a friend. What I
        found was a open and caring team of developers with similar stories to mine and a willingness to teach me how
        to translate my rather unrefined skills into production-level craftsman tools. With greater responsibility
        came greater understanding of the tangible connectivity and the intricate balancing act that is maintaining a
        substantial codebase.
    </p>
    <h4>What Else Do I Do?</h4>
    <p>
        <span>In my personal time,</span> I love spending time with my friends and family. I'm a playfully competitive
        person, so video games, card games, board games, and sports are all near and dear to my heart. I never pass up
        a chance to go skateboarding (or snowboarding if the weather is right!). My secret talent is that I take salsa
        classes every week, and I make it a habit to build my own furniture whenever possible.
